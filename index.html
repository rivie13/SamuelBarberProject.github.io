							<h2>Social Identity</h2>
							<p>Samuel Barber was born in West Chester, PA and spent a considerable amount of time in Philadelphia throughout his life. Although he grew up in a relatively wealthy family and had a very accepting family, Samuel Barber was an openly gay composer at a time when it was not accepted to be gay in society and some people were imprisoned for it.</p>
							<p>He had a lifelong partner who was another famous composer by the name of Giancarlo Menotti. They met at the Curtis Institute were they were some of the first students to study there. The Curtis Institute, which is located in Philadelphia, is known as one of the world's best music schools.</p>

							<h2>Breaking Boundaries</h2>
							<p>One of his most common performance partners was with a woman named Leontyne Price. She was a soprano who actually got her recital debut due to Samuel Barber. She would eventually become a world famous singer and rightfully so, due to her amazing and unique voice. The concert debut was on a very beautiful song cycle called Hermit Songs.</p>
							<p>Hermit Songs first premiered at the Library of Congress on October 30, 1953. This was during a time of segregation. Yet here together was an openly gay white man and a black woman performing one of the most beautiful works of art to ever grace the Earth. From what I can tell based on his writings, he doesn't seem to think this is as big of a deal as it really is historically. This may be due to him being more of a fan of solitude rather than popularity which can be seen in this and many other of his works.</p>

							<h2>Musical Identity</h2>
							<p>As Samuel Barber has said himself multiple times he creates music from his feelings. This is similar to many romantic composers, although he did not really fit any one style. He made music that was very uniquely his own which is part of the reason why I love his music so much. He was influenced by his predecessors such as Brahms (which he introduced to his partner while they were at Curtis) as well as his peers. He and Poulenc wrote music that they dedicated to each other and as Samuel Barber said Poulenc was his only composer friend.</p>
							<p>Most other composers and musical academics at the time did not like Barber's work especially his later work. Where as most composers were chasing styles and flip flopping around he had his own unique sound that was based in classicism and was very much so from his own feeling. When he chose to wrote songs he would do it usually with poetry that meant a great deal to him. He became much more appreciated for his music after his death which was not too long ago in January of 1981. He won much praise, awards, and accolades through his life but also earned much criticism and rebuking for his contributions. His music will continue to live on as many have finally come to appreciate him as one of the greatest American composers to have lived.</p>
